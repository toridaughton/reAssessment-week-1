// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "Planning is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "Analysis of Requirements is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified."

const design = "Design is the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems"

const implementation = "Implementation is the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow"

const testingAndIntegration = "Testing the functionality of the code and integrating changes. It is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. "

const management = "Follow up care. Management is the application of management activities - planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting - to ensure that the development and maintenance of software is systematic, disciplined, and quantified."
